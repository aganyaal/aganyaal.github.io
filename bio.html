              <h3 class="h">About me</h3>There's not much to know about me since I've only been alive for a short while.
              <br>Nevertheless, I think the little there is is quite interesting.
              <br>I was born Seventeen years ago right here in the capital, Nairobi.
              <br>Needless to say it was a joyous occasion for my parents, I'm the first of two.
              <br>I started education at Le pic primary school and was there until Class 5.
              <br>I then moved to Kenvic school where I completed primary school education.
              <br>Afterwards, I joined Starehe Boys' Centre and School for my four years of high school.
              <br> I am currently at Moringa school studying programming.</p>

              <h3 class="h">Reasons for choosing programming</h3>I started programming because I wanted to develop hands-on skills
              <br>relevant to the current tech migration of Kenya and the world in general.
              <br>I've also been passionate about everything computer-oriented since I knew what the word meant.
              <br>For this reason I decided that programming would best suit my pursuit for more and more knowledge on computers.</p>
