            <p>This was one of my first projects
              <br>Basically I was just trying to get a hold of html language at the time.
              <br>It doesn't have much except my favourite things but it might have a few errors</p>

            <h3>Animals</h3>
            <p>This is by far my best project I'd say.I actually made a site with pictures and columns.
              <br>It was done in collaboration with my pair partner, Jaden Lesuk.
              <br>It's a website for an animal shelter putting animals up for adoption.
              <br>Even so, it was not a perfect site as it had typos and other issues.Nevertheless it's my best one so far.</p>

            <p>My first project with Jaden Lesuk.We finished it quite quickly even though it was not perfect
              <br>Still, it was quite good considering the level of knowledge we had at the time.
              <br>It is a site for a band on tour showing a bio and tour dates.</p>
